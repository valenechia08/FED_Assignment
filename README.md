User Account Management
Feature 1 : Users can choose to log in as a patron, vendor or NEA officer, allowing users to save personalised deatils such as order history for patrons for future use. Messages will be shown for successful login, user not found and empty fields in username and password.
Feature 2 : Vendors can create accounts to manage stalls, menus, and orders, patrons can also create accounts or log in as a guest to order food. Messages will be shown for successful creation of account, taken username, if password does not meet the set rule (Must be 9+ chars with letters & numbers only), if passwords typed do not match, if the username is in an invalid format (can only contain letters, numbers, dot and underscore). This helps to ensure that username and password are in the correct format and that users cannot duplicate accounts sharing the same username. It al
Feature 3 :  Vendors, patrons and NEA officers can reset their passwords if they forget it which includes a finding their account page, ensuring that only existing accounts can have their passwords reset. A message will be shown if the account cannot be found.
Feature 4: A security verification page after successfully finding the account to ensure that only the respective users can log into their accounts (A code will be sent to their email but for demonstration purpose, an alert is shown instead with the random generated code). There is also a resend code button in case the user did not receive the first code. A message will be shown if the code is incorrect. This helps to verify that only the actual user can change their password and also allows for users to be able to change their password even if they faced issues in receiving the code the first few times.
Feature 5: A password reset page at the end. Messages will be shown if the passwords typed in do not match, password field is empty or the password does not meet the set rule (Must be 9+ chars with letters & numbers only). A message will also be shown if password reset was successful. This allows users to have more secure passwords and checks that they know what their password is. It also helps to inform users that their password was reset successfully and they can proceed.
